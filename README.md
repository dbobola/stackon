## Inspiration
In a realm saturated with countless Discord channels, Telegram groups, NFT influencers, and investor communities, I couldn't help but notice the struggles of a hypothetical friend. Despite their active participation in 12 Discord channels, engagement with 8 Telegram groups, following of 21 influential NFT influencers, and membership in over 30 NFT investor communities, their trading endeavors yielded disappointing results. As a research engineer, this led me to embark on a quest to uncover the missing piece of the puzzle. And that's when I stumbled upon a startling realization â€“ 90% of the NFT market movement hinges on the sentiments of holders and investors.

The revelation struck a chord, igniting a fire within me to explore the untapped potential of sentiment analysis in the NFT market. I became determined to bridge the gap between market sentiment and trading success. The concept was simple yet powerful: to uncover which NFTs the market positively talks about and even venture into the negative sentiments that trigger Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among NFT investors. With this in mind, Stackon was born.

## What it does

Stackon is an AI-powered platform that harnesses the strength of sentiment analysis to empower traders with real-time insights into the NFT market's collective emotions. Armed with the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) model, we embarked on a journey to decode and quantify emotions concealed within social media conversations and discussions surrounding NFTs. By analyzing words, phrases, and sentences, VADER allows us to measure the polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotions with remarkable accuracy.

Consider this scenario: "Cryptopunk is trash, everyone fooling themselves," tweeted @CryptoBrawnz. Another user, expressing a similar sentiment, claimed, "Most NFTs at the moment are basically scams/trash with no value except for hyping them up to make money. Cryptopunk is a joke." These negative sentiments, prevalent in Q4 of 2021, coincided with a significant decline in the value of Cryptopunk. This exemplifies the undeniable power emotions wield in shaping the NFT market.

## How we built it

Theta Blockchain emerged as an instrumental ally in the quest to revolutionize sentiment analysis within the NFT ecosystem. By integrating Theta's blockchain infrastructure, Stackon seamlessly connects NFT investors, influencers, and other key players within our ecosystem. Theta offers the ideal foundation for building a platform that amalgamates sentiment analysis with blockchain technology.

The Stackon platform introduces the concept of Theta Non-Fungible Tokens (TNT721), where Modifiers and Geeks play pivotal roles. These unique NFTs grant users access to a plethora of influencers and key players across different social media platforms. Recognizing the variance in sentiment between investors and influencers on platforms like Twitter, Stackon empowers traders to decipher market dynamics more effectively. For instance, positive sentiment from Twitter influencers might indicate high marketing investment, but if Twitter investors express negative sentiments, it could suggest limited acceptance despite the marketing efforts. Analyzing sentiment data requires nuanced interpretations, and the Stackon Geeks NFTs facilitate such refined analysis. Moreover, these Geeks NFTs allow users to filter results, focusing specifically on NFTs within targeted blockchains.

Within the Stackon Ecosystem, the Theta Blockchain and TFUEL currency reign supreme. All transactions within the platform, including minting assets like Modifiers, Geeks, and Stackon community bots, are charged in TFUEL. Users can effortlessly create a Theta wallet within Stackon, streamlining asset management and enhancing their participation within the community. To foster adoption, we offer new users three free mints, providing a taste of the diverse collection of over 10,000 TNT721 NFTs spanning multiple collections of Modifiers and Geeks.

## Challenges we ran into
Embarking on this ambitious journey wasn't without its challenges. Implementing the Theta Blockchain SDK within a Python environment, rather than relying on Node.js, presented unique hurdles that we had to overcome. The task of gathering and clustering vast amounts of data while ensuring optimal performance demanded meticulous planning and resource optimization. Furthermore, developing features for StackonGeeks TV and Playground required careful consideration of user experience and technical intricacies. However, dedication and perseverance paid off, resulting in a robust and intuitive platform that empowers traders with invaluable insights.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As the sole developer of Stackon, I take immense pride in what we have achieved within the timeframe of this hackathon. With over six years of experience as an AI research engineer and quant, I harnessed my expertise to bring Stackon to life. As a winner of the Microsoft Dev Days and Harvard Institute of Digital, Data, and Design, and having served as a Lead Infrastructure Engineer at Plariton, I have honed my skills across various domains. Yet, the realization that a single individual can accomplish this feat raises exciting prospects for what a dedicated team can achieve.

## What we learned
Looking back on the journey, I have gained invaluable knowledge and insights. Developing Stackon deepened my understanding of sentiment analysis, AI research, and the transformative potential of the Theta Blockchain. Discovering the immense power of sentiment data in navigating the complex and dynamic NFT market landscape. Integration of blockchain technologies and API services has enriched my skill set, amplifying my ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions.


## What's next for Stackon
The future of Stackon is filled with boundless opportunities. Winning this hackathon and securing the support of Theta would enable me to assemble a team of talented individuals, pooling our collective expertise to enhance and expand the Stackon platform. With a united team, we can unlock the platform's full potential, driving innovation and revolutionizing not only the way NFT investors collaborate and make informed decisions but also expand into other verticals of Cryptocurrencies. 

Our immediate goal is to secure victory in this hackathon. Subsequently, we aim to use the prize and support from Theta to bolster our team, further develop our infrastructure, and introduce live video collaboration features within the Stackon ecosystem. Through the provision of Theta TNT721 Contracts and Video API integration, we aspire to expose the vast potential of the Theta ecosystem to NFT investors worldwide. By providing a seamless environment for collaboration, sharing insights, and harnessing the power of sentiment data, Stackon will empower traders to make informed decisions and unlock unparalleled success.

Join us on this thrilling journey as we embark on a new era of NFT trading, powered by sentiment analysis, blockchain technology, and the limitless possibilities of the Theta ecosystem. Together, we can reshape the way traders navigate the NFT market, enabling them to make confident and data-driven decisions. Let us redefine the landscape of NFT trading and unlock the true potential of sentiment-driven success.
