## Inspiration
Imagine having a hypothetical friend who actively participates in various Discord channels, Telegram groups, and investor communities, seeking success in the vast and dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies. Despite their extensive engagement with the crypto community, they encounter struggles and disappointing results in their trading endeavors. This observation sparked a quest to uncover the missing piece of the puzzle. It became evident that market sentiment plays a pivotal role in shaping the outcomes of cryptocurrency investments.

Driven by a desire to bridge the gap between market sentiment and trading success, I, as a research engineer, embarked on a journey to explore the untapped potential of sentiment analysis in the cryptocurrency market. The goal was to uncover which crypto assets the market positively discusses and delve into the negative sentiments that trigger Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among crypto investors. With this vision in mind, Stackon was born.

## What it does
Stackon is an AI-powered platform that leverages sentiment analysis to provide traders with real-time insights into the collective emotions surrounding cryptocurrencies. Through the utilization of the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) model, the platform decodes and quantifies emotions concealed within social media conversations and discussions. By analyzing words, phrases, and sentences, Stackon accurately measures the polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotions.

Consider this scenario: "Bitcoin is a revolutionary digital currency that will disrupt traditional finance," tweeted @CryptoEnthusiast. Another user, expressing a similar sentiment, stated, "Most cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize various industries and provide financial freedom to individuals." These positive sentiments, prevalent in the crypto community, often align with upward price movements and increased adoption of crypto assets. This exemplifies the undeniable influence that emotions hold in shaping the cryptocurrency market.

## How we built it
To power the sentiment analysis and data retrieval, Stackon utilizes a custom-built API called Stackon BUILT API. This API connects to various social media platforms and retrieves relevant data for sentiment analysis. Additionally, the platform integrates with Chainlink nodes to ensure the availability of accurate and up-to-date sentiment data. Chainlink nodes serve as reliable data feeds, enabling the Sentiment Data Consumer contract to fetch real-time sentiment information for crypto assets.

The Stackon platform encompasses the entire crypto market, but for the purposes of this hackathon, we focused on utilizing NFTs as a sample case due to the availability of data within the given time frame. However, the platform's capabilities extend beyond NFTs and encompass sentiment analysis for a wide range of crypto assets.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing Stackon as a sole developer presented its own set of challenges. Implementing the Stackon BUILT API and integrating it with Chainlink nodes required meticulous planning and execution. Gathering and clustering vast amounts of data while ensuring optimal performance demanded careful resource optimization. Additionally, tailoring the platform to provide a seamless user experience and precise sentiment analysis posed its own set of technical hurdles. However, through dedication and perseverance, I successfully built a robust platform that empowers traders with invaluable sentiment insights.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As the sole developer of Stackon, I take immense pride in what has been achieved within the timeframe of this hackathon. Drawing upon my expertise as an AI research engineer and quant, I successfully brought Stackon to life. Winning the Microsoft Dev Days and Harvard Institute of Digital, Data, and Design, and serving as a Lead Infrastructure Engineer at Plariton have honed my skills across various domains. The realization that a single individual can accomplish this feat opens exciting prospects for what a dedicated team can achieve.

## What we learned
The journey of developing Stackon has been a source of invaluable knowledge and insights. It deepened my understanding of sentiment analysis, AI research, and the transformative potential of the cryptocurrency market. Integration of blockchain technologies and API services has enriched my skill set, amplifying my ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

## What's next for Stackon
The future of Stackon is filled with boundless opportunities. Winning this hackathon and securing the support of Chainlink would enable me to assemble a team of talented individuals, pooling our collective expertise to enhance and expand the Stackon platform. With a united team, we can unlock the platform's full potential, driving innovation and revolutionizing the way traders collaborate and make informed decisions. Our immediate goal is to leverage the prize and support from Chainlink to bolster the team, further develop the infrastructure, and introduce live video collaboration features within the Stackon ecosystem. By providing a seamless environment for collaboration, sharing insights, and harnessing the power of sentiment data, Stackon will empower traders to make informed decisions and unlock unparalleled success.

Join us on this thrilling journey as we embark on a new era of cryptocurrency trading, powered by sentiment analysis, blockchain technology, and the limitless possibilities of the Chainlink ecosystem. Together, we can reshape the way traders navigate the crypto market, enabling them to make confident and data-driven decisions. Let us redefine the landscape of crypto trading and unlock the true potential of sentiment-driven success.
